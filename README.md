# review-sentiment-analyzer
End-to-end NLP pipeline using VADER + TF-IDF with Matplotlib visualizations
An end-to-end sentiment analysis pipeline built for large-scale product review datasets (50,000+ entries), combining natural language processing with interactive visualizations to uncover meaningful customer insights.

Highlights:
1. Automated sentiment tagging using the VADER model on real-world review text, achieving over 90% classification coverage
